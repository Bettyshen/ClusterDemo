# ClusterDemo
## Goal
This tutorial demonstrates running R script through COE High Performance Computing Cluster (i.e., cluster, supercomputer), maximizing computation efficacy.
## Pros
The biggest benefit of running your R script through cluster is parallel computing, which means your task can be implemented into multiple cores at once. Because when you run your R script in R from your desktop, the script will run on one core. With parallel computing, you can run your script with multiple cores. Of course, you will need to set up parallel computing R code in your script to activate this function. More information on how to
